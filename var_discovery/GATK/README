This is the pipeline to run variant calling using GATK when given a single sample (can be SE or PE)

To run:
    Edit lines 13-15 to reflect your current situation.
        e.g. name   = "my_exome"
             read_1 = "path/to/my/reads/read1.fastq"
             read_2 = "path/to/my/reads/read2.fastq"
    Now you can run the script:
        perl run.pl
